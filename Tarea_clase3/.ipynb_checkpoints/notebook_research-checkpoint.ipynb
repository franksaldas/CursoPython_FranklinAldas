    "We used the IllustrisTNG simulations to study the cluster membership of  satellites galaxies. We selected a sample of 80 clusters with masses  between $ 4\\times 10^{14} M_\\odot \\leq M_{200}\\leq \\times 10^{9e14}{M_\\odot}$ and redshift  between $0.1\\leq z\\leq 1$ \\[Nelson 2017, Pillepich 2017, Naiman 2018, Marinacci 2018, Springel 2017\\].  To avoid no physical detection we selected galaxies with at least 1000 dark matter particles per galaxy  ( $M_{DM}\\geq 5.9\\times 10^{10}M_\\odot$ ) and at least 100 stellar particles ( $M_{stellar}\\geq 1.1\\times 10^{9} M_\\odot$). The final sample has 80 virialized and disturbed clusters and   9163 galaxies.  \n",

    "The cluster velocities dispersion is mass dependent, more massive clusters have greater velocities dispersion \\cite{Beers1990, Evrard2008}. A quantitative description of mass- velocity dispersion was given by Saro, et. al. with the following equation: \n",

Our objective is to find the intrinsic Light of Sight velocity distribution for a theoretical cluster with a mass of $M_{200}=5\\times 10^{14}M_\\odot$ at redshift $z=0.1$, which is representative for our sample. First,  we fitted the  3D velocities  distribution of the galaxies relative to the BCG using a Gaussian with mean $\\mu_0$ and dispersion $\\sigma_0$. After, we compute the  value of the 3D velocity dispersion $\\sigma_1$ that the cluster would have if it had a mass of $M_{200}=5\\times 10^{14}{M_\\odot}$ using the Equation presented before. Finally,   we obtain the theoretical 3D velocities for each galaxy normalized by the mass and the redshift using: \n",
